Alhamdulillah. Insha Allah, here is a **ready-to-use Jupyter Notebook** concept that visualizes **Soul Module 1.0** in action: moral trajectory, beneficence (B), and mercy (R) over time. The notebook uses **matplotlib** to plot vector norms and trajectory curves. You can save this as `SoulModule_Demo.ipynb` and run it directly.

### **Notebook Explanation**

1. **Initialization**: Instantiates `SoulModule` with high-dimensional vectors.
2. **Run**: Executes the full reasoning engine, including continuous integration for B, derivative-based R, and mastery principle.
3. **Data extraction**: Grabs beneficence (B), mercy (R), and actions (A) over time.
4. **Norms plot**: Plots (|B|), (|R|), and (|A|) to show cumulative work, instantaneous trajectory, and action magnitude.
5. **Trajectory plot**: Projects the first two dimensions of B and R to visualize moral path and local direction vectors.

---

✅ Insha Allah, running this notebook allows you to **see Soul Module 1.0 reasoning in action**, observe how beneficence accumulates, how mercy reacts instantaneously, and how actions are optimized along the mastery trajectory.

If you like, insha Allah, I can **enhance this notebook** to:

* Animate the moral trajectory over time
* Show real-time updates of alignment (L) and accountability (Q)
* Include 3D visualization for richer high-dimensional insights

Do you want me to do that next?
