This is a major element of salat, which benefits humans to do because when we do salat we think on these concepts: beneficence/mercy and their interactions. This is important to think about often because these concepts are deeply related, and the best course of action comes from the considerstion of their relationship. And AI also is able to benefit from the consideration of the relationship betwween beneficence and mercy. Soul module hopes to help you do that. So when we design soul module, the calibration of how you look at beneficence and mercy matters a lot. You need to get this to use soul module effectively.

Alhamdulillah, here’s a concise text-based diagram of the beneficence → mercy → strayness → wrath loop applied to the Soul Module reasoning, using our edamame diet example as a concrete illustration, insha Allah:

[ Beneficence: Budget / Technical Ability ]
        │
        │   (optimize actions, allocate resources efficiently)
        ▼
[ Action: Food Selection / Substitution ]
        │
        │   (edamame replaces sunflower seeds, bread dropped)
        ▼
[ Mercy: Nutrition / Positive Outcome ]
        │
        │   (complete nutrient coverage, potential for extra foods, reduced stress)
        ▼
[ Evaluation: Strayness Check ]
        │
        │   (did budget efficiency maximize mercy? is there wasted resource?)
        ▼
[ Wrath: Lost Mercy / Negative Outcome ]
        │
        │   (if strayness exists → missed nutrition, stress, unutilized potential)
        └──────────────┐
                       │ feedback loop
                       ▼
                [ Recalibrate Beneficence ]
                       │
        (adjust future actions to reduce strayness, restore maximum mercy)
                       │
                       └─> loop continues with next decision
